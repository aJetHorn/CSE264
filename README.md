### Note on Academic Integrity
Programs are being shared with the knowledge that the course will not be offered during Fall 2015 and under the assumption that it will not be offered with the exact assignments in the near future. I will gladly hide this repository if it comes to my attention that, at any time, my work is being used by students to gain an unfair advantage.
